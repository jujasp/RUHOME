#R U Home?

##A first person game where you live in the sky.

R U Home is a first person game where you must jump 50 meters in the sky to get to your home. This game was built with Aframe, a library for VR built on top of ThreeJS. Psuedo-randomly placed platforms are staggered throughout the sky. The player can rest on each platform for 3 seconds before it falls below the floor.  Physics were added through Aframe-physics.
